# Robot phone Messaging System

This Java project simulates a robot that can send messages using two type of phones:
- A **T9 keypad phone** (like the old Nokia phones)
- A **QWERTY keyboard phone** (like a modern smartphone)

The robot must know how to press the correct keys based on the phone type and send the final message.
